crtauth is a system for authenticating a user to a centralized server. The
initial use case is to create a convenient authentication for command line
tools that interacts with a central server without resorting to authentication
using a shared secret, such as a password.

crtauth leverages the public key cryptography mechanisms that is commonly
used by ssh(1) to authenticate users to remote systems. The goal of the
system is to make the user experience as seamless as possible using the
ssh-agent program to manage access to encrypted private keys without asking
for a password each time the command is run

The name of the project is derived from the central concepts challenge,
response, token and authentication, while at the same time reminding us old
timers of the soon to be forgotten cathode ray tube screen technology.

Example use case
----------------

Command line tools that connect to a central server to perform some action or
fetch some information can be a very useful thing. Let's say you have a service
that exposes information about servers using an http based API.
